# GEEP Design Notes

This directory contains design notes for features and enhancements that are being discussed
but are not yet complete enough to be formal GEEP proposals.

Design notes help:
- Gather community feedback on early-stage ideas
- Explore potential APIs and use cases
- Assess impact on existing functionality
- Build consensus before writing a formal proposal

## Contributing Design Notes

If you have an idea that needs discussion before becoming a formal GEEP:

1. Create a Markdown file in this directory with a descriptive name
2. Include background, potential approaches, and open questions
3. Open a GitHub Discussion to gather feedback
4. Once the idea matures, it can be promoted to a formal GEEP

Design notes don't need to follow the strict GEEP template - they can be informal explorations
of ideas.
