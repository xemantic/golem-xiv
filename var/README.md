# About `var` directory

The `var` dir, local to the project, is storing Golem XIV runtime generated data during development, like:

- [neo4j](neo4j): memory
- [workspaces](workspaces): cognitive workspaces

> [!NOTE]
> The `neo4j` dir keeps data of the neo4j instance configured with the [golem-xiv-neo4j](../golem-xiv-neo4j) module.
